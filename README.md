## 🌟 How It Works

1. The user sends a message via the web UI.  
2. The backend receives the input and processes it through the RAG pipeline in `rag.py`.  
3. Contextual information is retrieved and combined with AI-generated responses.  
4. The AI response is sent back and displayed in the web interface.  

This allows the chatbot to answer questions based on prior context and provide dynamic, engaging conversations.
